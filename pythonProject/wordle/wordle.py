"""
THE FOLLOWING CODE IS A LITTLE WORDLE PROGRAM
A SIMPLE GAME MADE TO PRACTICE CODE IN PYTHON
"""

# 1Â°) part consists of importing modules like rich, random and
# the list of words from the file word.py we are going to use
# for the game

from rich.console import Console
from random import choice
from word import word_list
from rich.prompt import Prompt

# 2Â°) part, we implement the welcome message with a simple print
# The instruction "You may start guessing" is a simple invitation to
# start guessing and the number of allowed guesses are set
# We can add a print to inform the player about the number of allowed guesses

WELCOME_MESSAGE = f'\n[white on blue] WELCOME TO WORDLE [/] \n'

ALLOWED_GUESSES = 6

# 3Â°) We invite the player to start the game
GUESS_STATEMENT = "\nEnter your guess"

# 4Â°) We Set the color of the squares which rely on each result given by the player's action
SQUARES = {'correct_place': 'ðŸŸ©', 'correct_letter': 'ðŸŸ¨', 'incorrect_letter': 'â¬›'}


# 5Â°) We define the rules of the game with the following functions :
def correct_place(letter):
    return f'[black on green]{letter}[/]'


def correct_letter(letter):
    return f'[black on yellow]{letter}[/]'


def incorrect_letter(letter):
    return f'[black on white]{letter}[/]'


# 6Â°) We define the function which will check the action 'guess' of the player with the current attended 'answer'
def check_guess(guess, anwser):
    # We set a list of guessed letters
    guessed = []
    # We set a list for the wordle pattern
    wordle_pattern = []
    # we set a loop to retrieve each value of letter in the guess action taken by the player with the enumerate method
    for i, letter in enumerate(guess):
        # We define a set of conditions in the loop for each 'answer param' and guess param to ensure its correct place
        # We increment the guessed letter accordingly with its correct place, and we append the wordle pattern list
        # Followed by the condition 'elif the letter already exists' in the attended answer
        # We increment the guessed letter accordingly with the correct letter
        # Lastly we set the incorrectness of the action in the else
        if anwser[i] == guess[i]:
            guessed += correct_place(letter)
            wordle_pattern.append(SQUARES['correct_place'])
